			<h1>My hobbies</h1>
			<p>
				I don't have a lot of hobbies as I am not an
				active person, but I can name a few:
			</p>
			<dl>
				<dt>Drawing</dt>
				<dd>
					Perhaps a common thing for a person to
					be interested in drawing. I didn't do it
					in a while, probably should start again.
					Drawing takes a lot of practice and also
					a lot of patience to learn it;
					<em>much like programming.</em> That's
					why I admire people who can draw well.

				</dd>
				<dt>Kendo (1 kyu)</dt>
				<dd>
					Japanese fencing so to say. Started
					training on summer 2018.
				</dd>
				<dd>
					<img
						src="/s/kendo.gif"
						alt="kendo gif"
					/>
				</dd>
				<dt>Programming</dt>
				<dd>
					Can't say I am a proffesionalist.
					Because what professionalist is 17
					y.o.?.. Anyway, this is my main activity
					and IT is the sphere I'd like to
					continue working in.
				</dd>
				<dd>

						alt="programming gif"
					/>
				</dd>
				<dt>Gaming</dt>
				<dd>
					My first relationships with PCs started
					in age of 10-11; and maybe as for a lot
					of people, they started with games. I
					like gaming and have quite a lot of good
					moments of my life related to it. Gaming
					was the main driving force for my
					interest towards programming. If not for
					games, maybe I'd never get to learn more
					about PCs. In fact, the PC when I was a
					kid, is the same PC I have now; or is it
					better to say, upgraded version of it.
				</dd>
				<dd>

				</dd>
				<dt>Music</dt>
				<dd>
					Listening to music as a hobby has become
					very common cliche thing nowadays; to
					the extent where teens at my age don't
					even consider it a hobby. But it's not
					the fact that you are listening to it,
					what makes it special; it's
					<em>what</em> you are listening to, what
					really matters. The mix of genres and
					artists, whom you listen to, are always
					different; they form your exclusive
					<em>listening</em> style. This is a lot
					like how people listen to each other,
					not everyone makes up a good listener.
